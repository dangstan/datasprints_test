## Instructions

The repository contains a jupyter notebook file (.ipynb), that uses AWS S3 links to open json files, and the .ipynb file in html format. 

### Installation

The easiest way for a beginner to get started with Jupyter Notebooks is by installing Anaconda. Anaconda is the most widely used Python distribution for data science and comes pre-loaded with all the most popular libraries and tools. Some of the biggest Python libraries wrapped up in Anaconda include NumPy, pandas and Matplotlib, though the full 1000+ list is exhaustive. This lets you hit the ground running in your own fully stocked data science workshop without the hassle of managing countless installations or worrying about dependencies and OS-specific (read: Windows-specific) installation issues.

To get Anaconda, simply:

Download the latest version of Anaconda for Python 3 (ignore Python 2.7).
Install Anaconda by following the instructions on the download page and/or in the executable.
If you are a more advanced user with Python already installed and prefer to manage your packages manually, you can just use pip:

pip3 install jupyter

### Creating Your First Notebook

In this section, we’re going to learn to run and save notebooks, familiarize ourselves with their structure, and understand the interface. We’ll become intimate with some core terminology that will steer you towards a practical understanding of how to use Jupyter Notebooks by yourself and set us up for the next section, which steps through an example data analysis and brings everything we learn here to life.

### Running Jupyter

On Windows, you can run Jupyter via the shortcut Anaconda adds to your start menu, which will open a new tab in your default web browser. Then, you can find where you downloaded your jupyter notebook file to, open the folder and then click on the file twice and open it.
